    "\n",
    "* Properties (variables)\n",
    "* Behaviors (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* It hides the internal implementation and exposes only the essential functionality to the user.\n",
    "* It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increases security and confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation bundles the data and the code working on that data into a single unit, also known as **data hiding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Achieving Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declare a variable in a class as private.\n",
    "* Provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loosely coupled code.\n",
    "* Better access control and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance is the capability of a class to inherit properties and methods from its parent class.\n",
    "* It allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, so we do not have to write the same code again.\n",
    "* It can be achieved using the `extends` keyword or through an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Inheritance\n",
    "* Multilevel Inheritance\n",
    "* Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "* Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "    * Supported through interfaces to resolve the [diamond problem](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/java/diamond-problem-in-java/).\n",

    "* Run Time/Dynamic Polymorphism/Method Overriding\n",
    "    * Method in a child class overrides the method in the parent class.\n",
    "* Operator overloading isn't supported by Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is-a Relationship\n",
    "    * Achieved through inheritance.\n",
    "    * Example: A `DOG` is an `ANIMAL`.\n",
    "    * Inheritance forms an \"is-a\" relationship between parent and child classes.\n",
    "* Has-a Relationship\n",
    "    * When an object is used within another class.\n",
    "    * Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "    * Examples:\n",
    "        * A `School` has `Students`.\n",
    "        * A `Bike` has an `Engine`.\n",
    "    * Association: The relationship between two different objects\n",
    "        * **Aggregation**: Both objects can survive individually. The existence of one object does not depend on the other.\n",
    "            * A `Library` can exist without the `Books`, and the `Books` can exist outside of the `Library`.\n",
    "        * **Composition**: The existence of one object depends on the other. The end of one object will end the other object.\n",
    "            * If the `House` is destroyed, the `Rooms` are also destroyed as they cannot exist independently of the `House`."

    "* Methods enhance code readability and reusability.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Private:** The access level of a private modifier is restricted to within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "* **Default:** The access level of a default modifier is limited to within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If no access level is specified, the default modifier is used.\n",
    "* **Protected:** The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through the child class. If no child class is created, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.\n",
    "* **Public:** The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package, and outside the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Type\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a method does not return anything, use `void` as the return type.\n",
    "* You can use the class name or a primitive data type as the return type of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Name\n",
    "\n",
    "* It should be a verb (representing an action).\n",
    "* It should start with a lowercase letter and follow camelCase if it consists of multiple words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameters are a list of variables used in the method.\n",
    "* The parameter list can be empty as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Body\n",
    "\n",
    "* The method body terminates when the `return` statement is called.\n",
    "* It also ends when the method reaches its end.\n",

    "* **User-Defined Methods:** Methods created by the programmer based on the program's requirements.\n",
    "* **Overloaded Methods:** More than one method with the same name but different parameter lists can be created in the same class. Overloaded methods are differentiated based on arguments, not return type.\n",
    "* **Overridden Methods:** A subclass has the same method (name and return type) as the parent class, but the method body is different.\n",
    "* **Static Methods:**\n",
    "  * These methods are associated with the class.\n",
    "  * They can be called using just the class name.\n",
    "  * Static methods cannot access non-static instance variables and methods.\n",
    "  * Static methods cannot be overridden. `@Override` is for dynamic binding, whereas `static` is for compile-time polymorphism.\n",
    "  * When to Declare a Method as Static:\n",
    "      * Methods that do not modify the state of the object can be declared as static.\n",
    "      * Utility methods that do not use instance variables and compute values based only on arguments.\n",
    "        * Example: Factory design pattern. \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Abstract Method\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstract methods are defined only in abstract classes.\n",
    "* Only the method declaration is provided.\n",

    "## Frequently asked interview question on Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why constructors do not have a return type? \n",
    "  * Constructors do not have a return type because their primary purpose is to initialize an object, not to return a value.\n",
    "* Why constructors cannot be final?\n",
    "  * A `final` method cannot be overridden. If a constructor were `final`, it would prevent any subclass from modifying the constructor, which defeats the purpose of subclassing and initialization.\n",
    "* Why constructor can not be abstract?\n",
    "  * An abstract method is a method that is declared but not implemented. An abstract constructor would imply that its implementation is provided by subclasses, which is not meaningful because constructors are used to create and initialize objects.\n",
    "* Why constructor can not be static?\n",
    "  * A static method can only access static variables and methods, and cannot access instance variables. Since constructors are used to initialize instance variables, they cannot be `static`.\n",
    "* Can we define a constructor in an interface?\n",
    "  * No, we cannot define a constructor in an interface because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "* Why constructor name is same as of class name?\n",
    "  * This naming convention helps easily identify and distinguish constructors from other methods in the class.\n",
